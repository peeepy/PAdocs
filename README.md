To contribute, you'll need to install `retype`. To do it via NPM:
`npm install retypeapp`
That's all you need.
To run it:
`retype watch`

NOTE: You may need to go into Command Prompt/Terminal as an administrator and run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` for `retype watch` to work; it allows you to run scripts on your machine.

After that, it'll load on http://localhost:5000/ as default. You can refer to the [Retype docs](https://retype.com/) to get a better idea of how to add to the site. It's all very easy.
